Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a superstore involves the systematic process of examining and understanding the available data related to the store's operations, sales, customers, and products. This essential step in data analysis for a superstore helps uncover valuable insights and patterns that can be used to inform decision-making and support various machine learning tasks. The key steps in EDA include data collection, cleaning, and exploration, as well as feature engineering, outlier detection, and potentially customer segmentation. It also involves visualizations, hypothesis testing, and data preprocessing to prepare the data for machine learning model selection, training, and evaluation. EDA is an iterative process, and the insights gained from it play a critical role in the success of machine learning projects tailored to superstore contexts.
